# NMEA to KML/CSV 

####NMEA-The National Marine Electronics Association
converting nmea files to csv or kml file type using python 

##Software to view NMEA files
####1.VisualGPS 4.2
VisualGPS incorporates many advanced features found in professional programs. Its sole purpose is to display graphically specific NMEA 0183 sentences and show the effects of selective availability (SA).
#####Features:
* Azimuth and Elevation Graph - View all satellites that are in view. Each satellite identifies its pseudo random number (PRN) and its azimuth and elevation. Also plot and print  the physical mask angle.
* Survey - The survey window displays both position and xDOP (HDOP and VDOP) parameters. The ability for user selectable HDOP/VDOP color thresholds for position averaging make a great utility. Also monitor Standard Deviation and effects of Selective Availability.   That's not all - print the results graphically.
* Signal Quality/SNR Window - Monitor satellite signal to noise ratios and see them graphically on the screen. The signal quality window will grow or shrink to accommodate number of satellites in view
* Navigation - Monitor latitude, longitude and altitude
* NMEA Command Monitor - View NMEA sentences as they are received

####2.NMEA to KMZ file converter

* Can choose the output of five forms of KMZ, KML, GPX, NMEA and CSV.
* Track point can output information (KMZ, KML).
   At data number, date, time, latitude, longitude, speed, altitude by the choice output.
   Can change a unit of speed in Km/h, mph and kt.
   Convert the time into local time and can output it.
* Can choose an icon of a track point (Normal and Overspeed) (KMZ, KML).
* Can select a Line color and Line width of a track (KMZ, KML).
* Masks by HDOP, NSAT and thinning out by time and distance can be output.
* Select the multiple files and batch conversion is possible.
* Command-line option and drag & drop are supported.
* Output by a 3D mode is possible and detailed output condition can be set (KMZ, KML).
   It is possible to display it by replacing the speed with altitude.
* The range of the output is definable at time.
* On/Off can output Track and Placemark (KMZ, KML).
* The icon that the user made for the Placemark icon can be used (KMZ, KML).
* The logo image that the user made for the title can be displayed (KMZ, KML).
* The user can add the judgment condition and the function of GPS.
* The geoid value can be correct by using the geoid grid data according to the latitude longitude.
* Because the installation is unnecessary, it is possible to execute it on USB memory.
