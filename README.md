#### NMEA to KML / CSV 
-----------------------------------------------------------
converting NMEA files to csv or kml file type using python 

We used Python to convert NMEA file to database ( MySQL ) .

The user can choose what type of file it wishes to deliver it to CSV or KML

The user can also filter and select what they want to see (such as height velocity etc ...)

-----------------------------------------------------------

##Software to view NMEA files
####1.VisualGPS 4.2
VisualGPS incorporates many advanced features found in professional programs. Its sole purpose is to display graphically specific NMEA 0183 sentences and show the effects of selective availability (SA).
#####Features:
* Azimuth and Elevation Graph - View all satellites that are in view. Each satellite identifies its pseudo random number (PRN) and its azimuth and elevation. Also plot and print  the physical mask angle.
* Survey - The survey window displays both position and xDOP (HDOP and VDOP) parameters. The ability for user selectable HDOP/VDOP color thresholds for position averaging make a great utility. Also monitor Standard Deviation and effects of Selective Availability.   That's not all - print the results graphically.
* Signal Quality/SNR Window - Monitor satellite signal to noise ratios and see them graphically on the screen. The signal quality window will grow or shrink to accommodate number of satellites in view
* Navigation - Monitor latitude, longitude and altitude
* NMEA Command Monitor - View NMEA sentences as they are received

####2.NMEA to KMZ file converter

* Can choose the output of five forms of KMZ, KML, GPX, NMEA and CSV.
* Track point can output information (KMZ, KML).
   At data number, date, time, latitude, longitude, speed, altitude by the choice output.
   Can change a unit of speed in Km/h, mph and kt.
   Convert the time into local time and can output it.
* Can choose an icon of a track point (Normal and Overspeed) (KMZ, KML).
* Can select a Line color and Line width of a track (KMZ, KML).
* Masks by HDOP, NSAT and thinning out by time and distance can be output.
* Select the multiple files and batch conversion is possible.
* Command-line option and drag & drop are supported.
* Output by a 3D mode is possible and detailed output condition can be set (KMZ, KML).
   It is possible to display it by replacing the speed with altitude.
* The range of the output is definable at time.
* On/Off can output Track and Placemark (KMZ, KML).
* The icon that the user made for the Placemark icon can be used (KMZ, KML).
* The logo image that the user made for the title can be displayed (KMZ, KML).
* The user can add the judgment condition and the function of GPS.
* The geoid value can be correct by using the geoid grid data according to the latitude longitude.
* Because the installation is unnecessary, it is possible to execute it on USB memory.

####3. SATGEN 3

* Creating your own scenarios couldn't be easier. If you have an NMEA file which contains GGA data, then you can import this directly into the software or alternatively, you can start from scratch by creating a route in Google Earth, or build a profile using simple user commands.
* Developed with the user in mind, this software allows you to create a static scenario, where a position can be manually inserted or easily determined using the integrated Google Maps screen. You can also draw a route by simply clicking-on a series of locations on the map.
